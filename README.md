# Fruit Machine Game - A Fun Full-Stack Experiment 🎰🍓🍉🍒

Welcome to the **Fruit Machine Game** repository! 🎉 This project is a fun, interactive slot machine game that brings together both **front-end** and **back-end** technologies. It's a personal project where I experimented with building a complete web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL. 💻🍊🍍

## 📜 Overview

This Fruit Machine Game allows users to:
- **Create an account** and log in to the platform.
- **Play a fun slot game** that mimics a traditional fruit machine (or slot machine).
- **Track gameplay** and **user data** for every spin, which is stored securely in the database.

The game aims to provide a fun experience while allowing me to test and combine both front-end and back-end skills in a meaningful way.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

### Front-End:
- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the pages.
- **CSS**: Styling and visual design to make the game look fun and exciting.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity and logic behind the slot machine game mechanics.

### Back-End:
- **Python (Flask)**: Server-side logic to handle user authentication and manage game actions.
- **SQL (SQLite)**: Database to store user accounts, game data, and gameplay history.

## 🎮 Game Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
- **Fruit Machine Gameplay**: The game simulates a fruit machine where users can click to spin the reels and win virtual coins.
- **Leaderboard & History**: User gameplay is recorded, and you can track your wins and spins, all stored in the database.
- **Randomized Slots**: Each spin is randomized to create an exciting and unpredictable outcome!

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fruit-machine-game.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies** for Python back-end.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up the database**:
    - The SQLite database will be created automatically when the app starts.
    - You can access and modify the database with any SQLite management tool for debugging or customization.

4. **Start the back-end server**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the game!

## 🌱 Learning Goals

This project was a fun personal experiment designed to test and combine:
- Front-end skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Back-end skills (Python with Flask and SQL database integration)
- User authentication and handling data securely
- Interactivity and dynamic content updates using JavaScript

## 📝 How to Play

1. **Create an account** to get started.
2. **Log in** using your credentials.
3. Once logged in, you can **start spinning** the fruit machine.
4. Each spin will be logged in your profile with details on how many coins you've won.
5. Try to get a combination of fruit symbols and win big!

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Add **real-time multiplayer** so users can compete in spin-offs.
- Include **advanced slot machine mechanics** like bonuses, multipliers, and jackpots.
- Enhance the **design** with animations and modern CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap or Tailwind).
- Implement **email verification** and **password reset** functionality for more robust user management.
